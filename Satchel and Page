    <h1>Brand of the Week: Satchel and Page</h1>
    <p>​

I’ve always wanted to own a leather briefcase. One that would last a hundred years and become a family heirloom that I can hand to my kids who can hand it to their kids.
​
I love old stuff.

So when I saw ads on Instagram for a leather DTC company called Satchel and Page that handcrafts leather bags in Brooklyn from Italian leather , I knew I had to take a look.

Not because their ads or glossy photos stood out to me. There’s about a million and one DTC leather brands out there, and Satchel and Page didn't seem all that different.
​
But their copy did. It’s a masterclass in doing a LOT with just a few words.


Let’s start with my first impression: their Instagram bio.

“Heirloom quality leather goods inspired by my grandfather’s Map Case from WWII”

That one line does more to capture my attention than the fancy photos.
​
Why? Well, first – because I'm a sucker for nostalgia.

I'm getting flashbacks to summer afternoons spent scouring my favorite Army surplus store (GI Joe's in North Attleborough, Massachusetts).

I can smell the musty old gear and hear the Johnny Cash playing in the background as I read this.

But second – because it’s personal: “inspired by my grandfather’s Map Case from WWII”
​
Just a few words. But sometimes a few words is all it takes to establish a personal, genuine connection. One that rings true to me and I'm sure to many more of Satchel and Page's customers.
​
I don’t need to be told exactly how much his grandfather’s leather map case means to him. That he started a whole company around it tells me a lot. I can use my imagination to fill in the rest.

I love the choice of words around “heirloom quality.” It’s so much more specific and meaningful than saying something like “highest quality” or “high-end.”

It actually means something.

“Highest quality” is general. It means very little. Anyone can say it.

But heirloom quality paints a picture. It’s inspiring. It evokes an image. You’ll be passing your bag down for generations, and they’ll be talking about just like the founder of Satchel and Page is still talking about his grandfather’s map case today.
​
Plus, with most apparel getting crappier every year, we could use a lot more heirloom quality goods that will still be around 100 years from now.

Pop over to the site. You’ll see the Map Case for sale. And you’ll see how they don’t need to use many words to describe it there, either – they use the same line: Inspired by my grandfather’s Map Case from WW2.


Open the Leather tab on the product detail page. You'll see that it’s tanned and finished in Ponte a Egola, Italy. It’s certified as Genuine. It’s from cowhide shoulders in France. And much more.


​
Now, honestly, I don't know if these details actually mean that the leather is "high quality."

You'd be surprised what random details copywriters will try to spin as "features."

"Genuine leather" is usually inferior to full-grain or top-grain.

But listing it all out here paints a picture of a high-quality bag. And that's effective.

If you’re looking for an heirloom quality bag that’s gonna last a couple of lifetimes, you’re probably gonna choose the one handcrafted from genuine French shoulder cowhide and tanned in Italy over the one made of untraceable leather of questionable origin.
​
I also love how specific they are with the dimensions, and whether it’s gonna fit your devices.


All this reminds me of how detailed Brightland Olive Oil is when talking about their oil origin, quality, and testing on their site.

Today’s consumers and shoppers are savvy. Especially those spending hundreds of dollars on a leather bag.
​
I'm one of those shoppers, and let me tell you: I will research the hell out of anything that costs over a couple hundred bucks.
​
I want my full-grain Italian leather. I want to make sure it fits my devices. I want to know exactly what the rivets are made from.
​
Give me as much info as you possibly can about the product. It not only inspires confidence in the product and helps persuade me towards purchasing...
​
But also shows me you've put some thought into things. And makes it as easy as possible for me to choose your bag.
​
There’s a few other details throughout the site copy that jump out at me.

They’re specific throughout- using details like “6-8 oz. vegetable tanned leather” and “made by a legendary 3rd generation Italian tannery" to paint a vivid picture.


They also did a bussin' job choosing testimonials. They read like good copy, and are perfectly tailored to the brand's homepage: best in class, smells like success.


I also find it interesting how short on words the Our Story page is. Many brands feel they need to tell their entire story. Go into how much they hated their corporate job and wanted to find their passion blah blah.
​
Paint themselves into a hero's journey.


That can certainly work. I love writing long copy sometimes.

But here Satchel and Page sticks with the very powerful, short copy they've been using throughout the site - and that's all they need.
​
The founder's grandfather and his Map Case are the heroes here.

Right about now, if you've been reading my recent breakdowns, you may notice a trend: I love it when brands are specific in their copy, thoughtful in the experience they provide, and personal in their story or message.
​
If I had to break copywriting down into just 3 techniques, those are the 3 I'd pick all day long.
